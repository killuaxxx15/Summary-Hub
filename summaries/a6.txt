The slow death of KPMG, EY, PwC and Deloitte’s legal dream

Challenges for the Big Four in the UK Legal Market

• EY, KPMG, PwC, and Deloitte have aimed to challenge traditional UK law firms since the 1990s, with renewed interest following the 2007 introduction of alternative business structure licenses.
• PwC established PwC Legal in 2014, followed by EY Law, KPMG Law UK, and Deloitte Legal (2018), signaling strong initial ambitions in the legal sector.
• Legal revenues for the Big Four rose from $900 million in 2015 to $1.2 billion by 2017, but recent developments indicate significant challenges.
• EY Law recently announced approximately 30 job cuts, shut down its Manchester-based EY Riverview Law, and saw its headcount decrease significantly due to high-profile departures.
• Between 2019 and 2024, the Big Four collectively hired 35 partners in London but lost 40 partners to competitors, reflecting internal struggles and competitive market dynamics.

Factors Hindering Success in Legal Services

• Regulatory conflicts significantly hinder the Big Four; tightly regulated by the Financial Reporting Council, they cannot provide legal services to audit clients due to compliance restrictions.
• Structural limitations impact performance as the legal divisions remain overshadowed by much larger accounting departments, making it harder for lawyers to build independent business portfolios.
• Lawyers accustomed to maintaining personal client relationships and business generation find the corporate environment of the Big Four less conducive compared to traditional law firms.

KPMG's Relative Success in Legal Market

• KPMG remains comparatively resilient, recently launching the first law firm owned by a Big Four firm in the US market, signaling strategic ambitions and growth potential.
• KPMG hired eight new partners for its London-based KPMG Law UK, significantly outperforming its Big Four peers in recruitment efforts.
• Despite market uncertainties, KPMG maintains a positive outlook and asserts continued growth opportunities, highlighting its differentiated strategic position among peers.

Future Outlook for Big Four Legal Divisions

• Apart from KPMG's relative strength, the remaining Big Four—EY, PwC, and Deloitte—face persistent struggles to establish substantial market positions in the competitive UK legal landscape.
• Continued structural and regulatory hurdles suggest ongoing difficulties unless significant strategic adjustments are implemented.
• The broader profitability problems of the Big Four, as indicated by market reports, may further complicate their ability to invest and expand effectively in legal services, limiting long-term prospects.

Overall Market Impact

• The Big Four’s ambitious entry into legal services has been significantly hampered by both internal and external factors, diminishing their early optimism.
• Continued talent loss and downsizing, particularly notable at EY, symbolize broader strategic and operational misalignments.
• Without substantial operational or regulatory changes, the legal divisions within the Big Four, except possibly KPMG, are likely to continue experiencing limited success or gradual decline.
