ASEAN Caught Between China’s Export Surge and Global De-Risking

ASEAN Faces Growing Pressures Amid China's Export Surge

• ASEAN has significantly benefited from China's rapid growth and integration into global supply chains, but it is now facing mounting pressures due to Chinese industrial overcapacity.
• China's exports to ASEAN have rapidly increased, surpassing its exports to the U.S. and EU since 2023, with a further 12% growth in 2024, mainly in intermediate and increasingly final goods.
• ASEAN exports to China have decreased by 3% since 2022, contributing to widening trade deficits, particularly affecting Indonesia and Thailand.
• ASEAN now faces challenges from China's overcapacity in sectors like steel, aluminum, petrochemicals, electrical machinery, and semiconductors, resulting in cheap imports displacing domestic industries.
• ASEAN governments must navigate between leveraging Chinese imports for growth and protecting local industries from being overwhelmed by artificially low-priced goods.

Economic Impacts of China's Industrial Overcapacity on ASEAN Industries

• ASEAN is becoming the primary offshore manufacturing base for Chinese companies, notably in clean energy sectors (EVs, solar panels, and batteries).
• Chinese overcapacity has particularly impacted industries such as textiles, steel, aluminum, petrochemicals, construction machinery, electrical equipment, semiconductors, and medical devices.
• Indonesia experienced significant job losses in textiles due to Chinese imports; Vietnam and Thailand also faced factory closures and industrial disruption in multiple sectors.
• ASEAN’s petrochemical industries, particularly in Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia, and Thailand, are under severe strain due to excess Chinese production and falling imports from ASEAN into China.
• The surge in cheap Chinese steel exports has led ASEAN countries like Vietnam, Indonesia, Malaysia, and Thailand to implement or consider antidumping measures.

ASEAN as China's Offshore Manufacturing Hub

• ASEAN attracted a record $17.6 billion in Chinese FDI in 2023, largely due to China's strategy to avoid trade barriers and utilize lower wages and strategic positioning.
• ASEAN governments generally welcome Chinese investments but increasingly face complexities due to Chinese companies' vertical integration and reliance on Chinese suppliers, limiting benefits to local economies.
• Significant Chinese investments are seen in electric vehicles, battery manufacturing, and solar panels, primarily in Thailand, Indonesia, Vietnam, and Malaysia.
• Chinese companies aim to produce over 1 million vehicles in ASEAN by 2026, primarily EVs, amid challenges like infrastructure limitations and strong local competitors.

Heightened Scrutiny from Advanced Economies on ASEAN-China Supply Chains

• Advanced economies, notably the U.S. and EU, are intensifying scrutiny of Chinese exports routed through ASEAN, potentially affecting ASEAN's market access to these economies.
• The U.S. and EU have implemented stricter trade and supply chain regulations, including the Inflation Reduction Act, Foreign Entity of Concern provisions, and the EU’s Foreign Subsidies Regulation and Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM).
• These measures significantly impact ASEAN exports involving Chinese inputs, particularly in sectors critical for defense, energy, technology, human rights, labor, and environmental standards.
• Japan and India are also tightening measures against Chinese goods entering via ASEAN countries, increasing trade compliance complexities for ASEAN nations.

ASEAN Countries’ Individual Responses to Chinese Overcapacity

• Thailand: Implemented antidumping duties on Chinese steel, and introduced VAT on low-value Chinese imports. Despite this, Thailand remains highly exposed, with significant factory closures and job losses due to cheap imports and heavy Chinese EV investment.
• Vietnam: Benefited from significant Chinese investments, particularly in electronics and solar panels, but faces challenges in steel and textiles. It has imposed antidumping duties and plans additional protective measures against low-value imports from China.
• Indonesia: Welcomes substantial Chinese investment, especially in nickel and battery sectors, yet struggles with environmental impacts and limited economic benefits. Indonesia considers tariffs and tighter import controls to protect local industries.
• Malaysia: Experiences economic benefits from Chinese investments but has implemented taxes on low-value Chinese goods, initiated antidumping investigations, and cautiously manages Chinese investments in EVs and critical sectors.
• Philippines: Faces rising Chinese imports with limited integration into Chinese supply chains, balancing its relationship with China by strengthening ties with other partners like the U.S. and Japan, amid South China Sea tensions.
• Singapore: Benefits significantly from high-value Chinese investments, focusing on finance and technology sectors while implementing investment-screening laws to manage risks.

China's Strategic and Corporate Responses

• Chinese authorities largely dismiss ASEAN concerns on trade imbalances, promoting integration instead of addressing structural issues like overcapacity and market access.
• Some Chinese companies attempt to increase local content usage in ASEAN (e.g., EV manufacturers in Thailand), yet face pressure from Beijing to retain critical production and technologies within China.
• China aims to maintain economic influence in ASEAN through upgrades to trade agreements like the ASEAN-China Free Trade Agreement (ACFTA), including new chapters on digital and green economies.

Policy Recommendations for ASEAN

• Strengthen national and regional trade response mechanisms, such as antidumping frameworks, regional trade remedy databases, and e-commerce regulation.
• Develop supply chain monitoring and early-warning systems alongside private-sector collaboration to identify risks proactively.
• Promote sustainable and diversified investments, enhance workforce skills and innovation, and introduce strategic incentives to attract high-quality FDI.
• Enhance regional cooperation and institutional frameworks under ACFTA and RCEP to manage trade surges and ensure economic stability.

Recommended Actions for the United States and Partners

• Pursue targeted sector-specific agreements with ASEAN in strategic sectors, particularly semiconductors and green technologies.
• Strengthen cooperation on critical minerals, promoting sustainable and secure supply chains, especially with Indonesia, the Philippines, and Vietnam.
• Expand technical assistance, risk assessment tools, and supply chain monitoring capabilities through U.S. Commerce Department initiatives.
• Increase development finance investments in renewable energy, digital infrastructure, and advanced manufacturing sectors to provide viable alternatives to Chinese FDI.
