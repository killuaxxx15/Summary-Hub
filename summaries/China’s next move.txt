China’s next move | GZERO World with Ian Bremmer

Xi Jinping’s Control and Domestic Leadership

• Xi Jinping has significantly increased control over China's political, economic, and military systems compared to five years ago.
• Despite internal complaints and economic struggles, Xi maintains strong leadership through major personnel and structural reforms within security services and the military.
• The Chinese government under Xi is attempting to restructure the economy away from real estate towards high-tech industries, despite challenges and economic downturns.
• Xi's leadership effectiveness is debated, particularly regarding economic performance and his handling of COVID-19, initially praised but later criticized.
• Domestic economic policies under Xi may have been overly cautious, risking deeper economic stagnation and deflation.

China’s Economic and Technological Ambitions

• China projects confidence in sustained GDP growth and global rise through 2025, despite ongoing economic difficulties.
• Significant focus remains on high-tech sectors and foundational scientific research, successfully meeting most benchmarks set by the "Made in China 2025" strategy.
• China’s investment in renewable energy and emerging technologies positions it competitively, often ahead of the United States in critical sectors.
• Recent policy shifts towards greater support for private enterprises, exemplified by the rehabilitation of Alibaba founder Jack Ma, indicate a strategic recalibration to revive economic dynamism.
• The cyclical nature of state-private sector relationships continues, with private businesses wary of future crackdowns despite current supportive policies.

US-China Relations under Trump Administration

• Trump's policies towards China have been inconsistent; initially friendly but followed by trade wars, technology restrictions, and criticism of China's economic practices.
• Trump administration's strategic shift emphasizes confronting China directly through tariffs, restrictions on Chinese investment, and focusing on military and technological competition.
• Trump's diplomatic strategy involves creating spheres of influence and attempting to isolate China by strengthening ties with Russia, despite mixed results.
• Trump administration's withdrawal from global commitments (e.g., Paris Accord, WHO) has inadvertently created more diplomatic and economic opportunities for China globally.
• The Trump administration has filled key positions with China hawks, indicating an aggressive stance likely to influence future policy significantly.

China’s Aggressive Foreign Policy Moves

• Xi Jinping’s foreign policy, particularly around Taiwan and the South China Sea, has been aggressive and effective in changing regional dynamics without significant international repercussions.
• China's assertiveness, including militarization of the South China Sea and intensified military activities around Taiwan, has so far resulted in limited concrete pushback internationally.
• The Chinese government asserts readiness for confrontation with the United States, though actual preparedness and willingness to engage in direct conflict remain unclear.
• Beijing benefits diplomatically from perceived U.S. retrenchment, positioning itself as a stable global leader, particularly in promoting multilateralism amid Western disengagement.
• China actively exploits divisions between the U.S. and European Union, strategically driving wedges to expand its global influence.

Internal Tensions and Societal Adjustments in China

• A significant gap exists between Xi’s ambitious national projects and the sacrifices they impose on ordinary citizens, creating internal societal tensions.
• China’s security infrastructure allows the government to maintain stability amid economic hardship more effectively than in many developed economies.
• Xi’s administration faces challenges in balancing economic restructuring with social stability, reflecting generational differences in experiences and expectations for prosperity.
• There remains skepticism among Chinese citizens about the government's ability to sustain historical economic performance levels into the future, especially by 2025.
• The temporary rehabilitation of prominent private-sector figures like Jack Ma indicates acknowledgment by authorities of potential overreach in past crackdowns, though private business remains cautious.

Opportunities for China in Global Geopolitics

• China positions itself strategically to capitalize on U.S. withdrawal from international leadership roles, promoting itself as a proponent of multilateral stability.
• Beijing leverages geopolitical shifts, notably increased tensions between the U.S. and EU, to strengthen its diplomatic standing and reduce Western cohesion.
• China could potentially elevate its global influence by acting as a mediator in international conflicts, such as Ukraine, thereby significantly enhancing its diplomatic capital, particularly with the Global South.
• Analysts suggest Xi Jinping has an opportunity to improve relations with Europe by intervening constructively in the Ukraine conflict, potentially repositioning China diplomatically.
• Despite potential opportunities, China historically has not always acted optimally or strategically, occasionally missing chances to enhance its global leadership role, as observed in its inaction over Ukraine mediation proposals.
