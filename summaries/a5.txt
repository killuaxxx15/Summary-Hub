Watch CNBC's full interview with U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent

U.S. Trade Policy and Tariffs

• Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent argues that recent tariff policies are a "much-needed course adjustment," not a radical departure, aimed at correcting imbalances in global trade.
• He emphasizes shifting from free trade to fair trade, addressing tariff barriers, non-tariff barriers, currency manipulation, government subsidies, and fines against U.S. tech firms by other nations.
• Tariffs are described as a one-time price adjustment, not causing long-term inflation, and crucial for protecting American jobs and manufacturing.
• Bessent indicates tariffs will be necessary in the short to medium term due to persistent trade imbalances, particularly with China.
• He highlights reciprocal trade policies, with April 2 as a key date for evaluating global trading partners.

Economic Impacts and Inflation

• Bessent acknowledges short-term price increases from tariffs but argues this will lead to long-term stability and higher employment.
• He emphasizes that the Biden administration created economic disparities, benefiting the top 10% at the expense of the bottom 50%.
• Transitioning from public (government-driven) to private sector-driven economic growth is a key goal to stabilize the economy.
• He sees current declining energy prices, reduced mortgage rates, and improved housing affordability as positive outcomes of current policies.

Budget, Taxes, and Fiscal Responsibility

• Bessent supports making the 2017 tax cuts permanent to encourage economic growth.
• He argues that growth generated by tax cuts, deregulation, and reindustrialization is essential for balancing the budget, despite skepticism from CBO projections.
• Medicaid reform or slowing its growth is considered necessary to control spending and achieve budget goals.

U.S.-Ukraine Economic Relations

• Bessent detailed his meeting with President Zelensky in Kyiv, explaining Zelensky’s reluctance to sign an economic partnership deal.
• The deal aimed to economically align Ukraine closer with the U.S., potentially providing indirect economic security guarantees.
• Zelensky repeatedly delayed signing, initially planning to sign later in Munich but failing to follow through, causing diplomatic tension.
• Bessent argues the economic deal was structured to benefit ordinary Ukrainians rather than oligarchic interests.

U.S.-Russia Relations and Ukraine War

• Bessent explains President Trump’s focus on achieving peace between Russia and Ukraine, emphasizing negotiations with both sides.
• He confirms U.S. interest in eventually restoring business ties with Russia, contingent upon peace agreements and improved geopolitical conditions.

Dollar Policy and Currency Manipulation

• Bessent maintains the administration’s strong dollar policy, rejecting any deliberate weakening to manage trade deficits or national debt obligations.
• He distinguishes between maintaining global currency strength versus opposing currency manipulation by individual trade partners.

Market Performance and Policy Influence

• Bessent claims the administration does not intervene directly to support the stock market ("Trump put"), arguing instead that strong economic policies naturally support market growth.
• He suggests a significant market downturn could influence policy decisions but emphasizes current policy strength, given the market's recent strong performance.

Regulatory and Deregulatory Measures

• Deregulation is prioritized to stimulate private sector growth and attract business investment.
• Bessent acknowledges M&A activity slowed but believes improved regulatory clarity and deregulation will reverse this trend soon.

IRS Reforms and AI Integration

• Bessent outlines a planned reduction of about half the IRS workforce hired under the Biden administration, focusing instead on essential employees and AI integration to streamline operations.
• Priorities for IRS are emphasized as efficient collections, maintaining privacy, and improving customer service.

Cryptocurrencies and Bitcoin Reserve

• Bessent strongly supports establishing the U.S. as a global crypto leader by adopting best regulatory practices and creating a Bitcoin (crypto) reserve from seized assets.
• The administration plans to cease selling seized Bitcoin, focusing instead on building reserves without using taxpayer funds directly to purchase additional Bitcoin initially.

China-U.S. Economic Relations

• China is described as the most economically imbalanced nation, significantly contributing to U.S. manufacturing losses and economic imbalances.
• Tariffs are positioned as tools to correct China's unfair trade practices and rebalance economic relations.
• Bessent highlights that the U.S. is already diversifying supply chains away from China, including increased trade with India and Vietnam.
• The administration views China's economic surpluses as funding military ambitions, underscoring the intertwined nature of economic and security policies.

Taiwan and Security Concerns

• Bessent echoes President Trump’s confidence that China will not move militarily against Taiwan during his administration.
• U.S. strategy involves economic pressure and trade adjustments to address security threats and maintain stability in the Asia-Pacific region.

Fentanyl Crisis and Border Security

• Bessent defends tariffs on Mexico and Canada primarily due to the fentanyl crisis, rejecting claims that tariffs on neighboring countries are financially motivated.
• Emergency powers are being used to justify tariffs as a security response to drug trafficking issues.
