The Troubles: War in the Streets of Northern Ireland (Ep 1)

Introduction to "The Troubles" and the Context of the Episode

• The podcast "Empire," hosted by Anita Anand and William Dalrymple, welcomes author Patrick Radden Keefe, who discusses his acclaimed book Say Nothing, focusing on Northern Ireland’s Troubles.
• Anand and Dalrymple emphasize the importance of understanding the deep historical roots behind the Troubles, beginning from Tudor England through events such as the Easter Rising and the Irish Civil War.
• Patrick Keefe explains his interest in the Troubles arose after reading an obituary of IRA member Dolores Price, revealing unresolved historical tensions despite the Good Friday Agreement.
• Keefe highlights how historical events of over 50 years ago still profoundly affect present-day politics and identities in Northern Ireland.

Background and Life in Northern Ireland (1930s-1950s)

• Northern Ireland was sharply divided, with Protestants (loyalists) making up roughly two-thirds and Catholics one-third, creating constant tension.
• Catholics faced severe discrimination in jobs, housing, and voting rights; voting was tied to property ownership, limiting their political influence.
• Despite high Catholic birth rates, emigration kept the Catholic population static, as many moved to England, America, and Australia due to oppression.
• Protestants, while dominant in Northern Ireland, perceived themselves as threatened minorities on the broader island, fearing demographic change and absorption into Catholic-majority Ireland.
• Catholics had virtually no representation in police or judiciary roles, deepening feelings of injustice and exclusion.

Cultural and Religious Prejudices

• Hostility towards Catholics was widespread in Northern Ireland, fueled by figures like Ian Paisley, who publicly demonized Catholics, describing them as "rodents" and promoting sectarian divisions.
• Historical anti-Catholic prejudices common in Britain persisted far longer and more intensely in Northern Ireland, shaping social attitudes and politics into the late 20th century.
• Protestants feared "dual loyalty" among Catholics, suspecting allegiance to the Pope over Britain, an attitude deeply rooted historically but obsolete in contemporary Britain by this time.

Civil Rights Movement and Influence from America

• The Northern Irish civil rights movement of the late 1960s, inspired by the nonviolent struggle of Black Americans, initially sought peaceful protest against institutional discrimination.
• Student-led movements, including groups like People’s Democracy, emulated tactics from the U.S. Civil Rights movement, such as marches and peaceful resistance.
• Peaceful activism became a powerful symbol through televised media, designed to draw global attention and sympathy through dramatic images of violence against peaceful protesters.

Critical Turning Point: Ambush at Burntollet Bridge

• A pivotal event was the Burntollet Bridge attack (1969), where peaceful marchers, including sisters Dolores and Marion Price, were savagely attacked by loyalist mobs armed with nail-studded clubs and paving stones.
• This brutal attack radicalized many peaceful protesters, destroying their belief in nonviolent resistance; the Price sisters transitioned from peaceful protestors to radical IRA activists.
• This incident significantly intensified tensions across Northern Ireland, escalating the violence and polarizing the community further.

Escalation and Ethnic Cleansing (Battle of the Bogside and Apprentice Boys March)

• Following the Burntollet incident, tensions exploded during the Apprentice Boys March (August 1969), a loyalist celebration commemorating historical Protestant victories.
• The provocative march through Catholic neighborhoods triggered the "Battle of the Bogside," resulting in widespread riots and violent confrontations between Catholics and Protestants, extending to Belfast.
• Rapid ethnic cleansing ensued, with Catholics and Protestants driven from their homes into segregated communities, dramatically altering the social fabric of Northern Ireland.

Emergence of New IRA and Radical Politics

• Disillusionment with the older, largely inactive IRA ("I Ran Away") led to the formation of the Provisional IRA, composed of younger, more militant members willing to engage in active guerrilla warfare.
• Influenced by international revolutionary movements like the PLO and Che Guevara’s guerrilla tactics, the Provisionals shifted towards violent resistance and insurgency against British forces.
• Prominent IRA leaders, notably Gerry Adams, emerged during this period; although Adams denies IRA membership, Keefe’s extensive research supports his active involvement and leadership within the IRA.

Arrival and Initial Welcome of British Army Troops

• British troops were initially welcomed warmly by Catholic communities, seen as neutral peacekeepers who could protect civilians from escalating sectarian violence.
• However, this initial goodwill rapidly dissipated due to heavy-handed and biased actions by the army, often directed by the Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC) and loyalist auxiliaries ("B Specials").
• Troops disproportionately targeted Catholic neighborhoods with invasive searches and arrests, creating a lasting resentment and perception of the British Army as partisan oppressors rather than neutral peacekeepers.

British Colonial Approach and Ongoing Tensions

• The British government treated the Northern Ireland situation as a colonial uprising, employing tactics previously used in other colonial conflicts, further alienating Catholics and fueling IRA recruitment.
• Symbolic expressions of nationalist sentiment, such as displaying the Irish tricolor or wearing the Easter lily (commemorating the Easter Rising), became punishable offenses, exacerbating tensions.
• Such oppressive measures alienated moderate Catholics who might otherwise have resisted joining the IRA, significantly broadening support for violent resistance.

Lasting Historical and Psychological Impacts

• Patrick Keefe emphasizes that the Troubles continue to affect political and social dynamics today, with historical grievances still unresolved, influencing contemporary attitudes and identities.
• The conversation highlights the deep psychological impact of historic events and the dangerous legacy of unresolved sectarian tensions, perpetuated through memory and commemoration.

Looking Ahead to Further Discussion

• Future episodes will delve deeper into the impacts of these formative events, exploring complex characters like British military strategist General Kitson, who significantly shaped counter-insurgency tactics.
• The podcast hints at broader global comparisons, including the similarities between Northern Ireland’s conflict and contemporary situations like the Israel-Palestine conflict.
