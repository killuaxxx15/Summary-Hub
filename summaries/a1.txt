House of Huawei - The Secret History of China's Most Controversial Company (Book Summary)

1. Origins and Early Development (1937-1990s):

• Ren Zhengfei's Background: The book highlights the influence of Ren Zhengfei's early life, including his father's patriotic work as a bookseller ("Ren Moxun sold ‘good books.’ That was what he and his friends called patriotic literature.") and his own military service ("there is no doubt that Ren’s experience in the military helped shape his worldview. He would inculcate Huawei with a military-esque culture, running new hires through army-inspired boot camps and emphasizing discipline and personal sacrifice.").
• Early Technological Imperative: A central theme is Ren's early recognition of the importance of indigenous technology for national sovereignty. His famous quote, "A country without its own program-controlled switches is like one without an army," underscores this conviction.
• Founding and Early Strategy: Huawei's initial years involved reverse-engineering and forging partnerships. They started by manufacturing and selling telephone switches for other companies like Zhuhai Telecom ("Huawei struck a deal to manufacture and sell the BH-01 on Zhuhai Telecom’s behalf").
• Cultivating State Connections: The importance of government relationships is evident from early on. Ren's meeting with Jiang Zemin in 1994, where he articulated the need for national control over switch technology ("Program-controlled switches are related to national security,” he said. “Its software must be held in the hands of the Chinese government.”), proved pivotal. This led to favourable policies like "domestic buyer's credit" which benefited Huawei.
• Early International Ambitions: Even in its early stages, Huawei looked beyond China, establishing a subsidiary in the US, Ran Boss Technologies, in 1993, aiming to "improve our technical level faster, and guarantee the development of products at an internationally advanced level." Ren's early trips to the US left a lasting impression ("Talking to journalists, Ren recalled flying to the States with $10,000 in cash sewn into his coat, as he didn’t know how much things cost.").

2. Growth and International Expansion (Late 1990s - 2000s):

• The Huawei Basic Law: The creation of the "Huawei Basic Law" in 1998 signifies Ren's strategic approach to building a unique company. It explicitly stated that "Profit maximization is by no means our only pursuit," prioritising long-term growth and technological advancement over short-term shareholder value.
• Early Successes: Huawei achieved significant milestones, including its breakthrough deal with Hutchison Telecom in Hong Kong in 1996, demonstrating its ability to compete on speed and cost ("Ren’s team convinced them that Huawei could supply a network expansion much faster than rivals, and at only half the cost.").
• Military Interests: The company's video system, ViewPoint, garnered the attention of the Chinese military, highlighting the potential for dual-use technology ("Liu Huaqing, vice-chairman of China’s Central Military Commission, stopped in at Huawei during a visit to People’s Liberation Army troops stationed in Shenzhen... Liu encouraged Huawei to “continue prioritizing national interests” as it built its company").
• Navigating Geopolitical Sensitivities: Huawei's operations in countries under sanctions, like Iraq, are mentioned, indicating a willingness to operate in complex environments while maintaining a low profile ("Huawei was operating there but trying to keep a low-profile presence.").
• Building Global Relationships: Ren personally engaged in building international partnerships, as exemplified by his presence at the GSM World Congress ("Duncan Clark recalled an unassuming-looking Ren wearing a name tag and manning the Huawei booth personally").
• Entering the Western Market: The breakthrough contract with British Telecom (BT) in 2005 was crucial for Huawei's expansion into the West ("BT’s decision to pick Huawei in April 2005 broke open the dam into the West."). This led to deals with other major European operators like Vodafone, Orange, and Telefónica.
• Developing Mobile Capabilities: Despite initial reluctance, Huawei became a major player in mobile technology, eventually becoming a global leader in both network equipment and smartphones.

3. Rising Tensions and Security Concerns (2009 - 2018):

• Increased Scrutiny in the West: As Huawei grew, it faced increasing suspicion and security concerns in Western countries. US Commerce Secretary Gary Locke's conversation with Sprint CEO Dan Hesse in 2010 illustrates this ("They wanted to make sure I knew that they had security concerns with Huawei equipment going into our network.”).
• Safe City Initiatives and Surveillance: Huawei's development and deployment of "Safe City" surveillance solutions globally raised ethical questions about privacy and potential misuse. These systems involved "real-time facial-recognition streams from surveillance cameras with users’ mobile data and social media to produce sophisticated automated tracking."
• Allegations of Complicity in Human Rights Abuses: The book points to Huawei's involvement in building the surveillance infrastructure in Xinjiang, where the Uyghur population faced severe repression ("Under the banner of counterterrorism, Xinjiang had become the world’s most repressive high-tech surveillance state. And Huawei had helped build it.").
• Responding to Scrutiny: Huawei executives like John Suffolk faced tough questions in Western parliamentary hearings regarding compliance with laws and human rights ("“Our starting point and our end point—I am sorry to repeat this—is that we understand the laws in the country. That can be a difficult thing to do, but once we understand the law, we will operate within the law. We do not make judgments.”"). Ren Zhengfei consistently denied that Huawei would engage in espionage for the Chinese government ("Each time, Ren denied that Huawei had ever been asked by the Chinese government to aid espionage efforts and said that it would not be willing to do so if asked. “We will certainly say no to any such request,” Ren said.").

4. The US-China Trade War and Meng Wanzhou's Detention (2019 onwards):

• Escalating US Sanctions: The US government intensified its actions against Huawei, culminating in restrictions on the sale of US technology and, crucially, on chips manufactured using US technology ("In May 2020, the Commerce Department tightened the sanctions on Huawei, preventing not only the direct sale of US technology to the company but also the sale of any chips that were made using US technology without a special license."). This directly impacted Huawei's ability to produce advanced smartphones.
• Meng Wanzhou's Arrest and Extradition Case: The detention of Meng Wanzhou in Canada in December 2018 at the request of the US marked a significant escalation in the conflict. The book dedicates several chapters to this event ("SEVERAL DETENTIONS: DECEMBER 2018", "MENG’S EXTRADITION CASE: 2019–2021").
• Huawei's Resilience and Response: Despite the challenges, Huawei continued to operate and invest in R&D. Ren Zhengfei stepped out of his reclusive role to engage with the media, defending the company and his daughter ("Ren granted each news organization an exclusive interview, an astonishing shift from his previous corporate hermitage.").
• Global Divide on Huawei: Countries adopted different stances on Huawei's involvement in their 5G networks, with some aligning with the US in banning or restricting the company, while others, like Germany and France, were more hesitant. Russia's Vladimir Putin publicly defended Huawei ("“There are unceremonious attempts at pushing Huawei away from the global markets,” Putin said").
• Return of Meng Wanzhou: The excerpts cover Meng Wanzhou's eventual return to China ("MENG’S RETURN: 2021–2023"), which was met with a "Hero’s Welcome," signifying the symbolic importance of the case within China.

Quotes Highlighting Key Aspects:

• Ren Zhengfei's strategic thinking: "As a military man I have known many clever and truly outstanding strategists. I have rarely come across an individual more strategically oriented than Ren."
• The nature of Huawei's business: "Sure, Huawei might make pipes of a sort, but it was not water flowing through them. What flowed through these pipes was telephone calls, emails, internet traffic, text messages, video calls, corporate accounting, medical records, wills and testaments, love letters, family photographs, police intelligence, government secrets. In a word: data."
• Huawei's self-perception (with a hint of denial): “We are a company that sells water taps and pipes,” Ren said. “How can anyone ask for water from a hardware store like us?”
• Early recognition of technological dependence: "A country without its own program-controlled switches is like one without an army." —Ren Zhengfei, July 20, 1994
