Empire of Illusion: Frank Dikötter on Why China Isn’t a Superpower

Frank Dikötter's Background and Expertise

• Frank Dikötter is an expert on China with extensive academic credentials, including a doctorate from the University of London and a fellowship at the Hoover Institution at Stanford.
• His notable works include the "People's Trilogy," covering significant events under Mao: the Great Famine, Liberation, and the Cultural Revolution.
• Dikötter argues against the common perception of China as an economic superpower, suggesting a deeper scrutiny of Chinese communism and its systemic issues.

Misconceptions About China's Economic Miracle

• Dikötter refutes claims that the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) lifted hundreds of millions out of poverty; instead, he argues that ordinary Chinese lifted themselves when governmental oppression briefly eased.
•  He emphasizes the state's confiscation of people's savings, highlighting the economic disparity where the state (CCP) is wealthy, while most ordinary Chinese remain relatively poor.
• The narrative of China's miraculous economic growth since Deng Xiaoping’s reforms is considered exaggerated and based on misleading statistics and propaganda.
• Real economic growth in China, according to Dikötter, primarily started after China joined the WTO in 2001, rather than in the earlier reform periods.

The Reality Behind China’s Economic Statistics

• Dikötter argues that China’s official GDP and growth figures are highly unreliable, manipulated to project power and stability.
• Many Chinese industries produce massive overproduction, leading to stockpiles and economic inefficiencies.
• Rather than real economic progress, China's growth was significantly aided by joining the WTO and exporting excess production globally, resulting in economic distortions and uncompetitive practices.
• State-owned enterprises dominate the Chinese economy despite superficial reforms, limiting genuine capitalist competition.

Tiananmen Square and Missed Democratic Opportunity

• The Tiananmen Square protest in 1989 is characterized as a nationwide upheaval fueled by economic frustration, corruption, and inflation, not merely a student-driven democratic protest.
• Dikötter states that the crackdown by the CCP on June 4, 1989, involving 200 tanks and 100,000 soldiers, was far bloodier than generally reported, with thousands killed, underscoring the brutality of the regime.
• The massacre solidified the CCP’s stance against democratic reform, rooted deeply in fear and paranoia from the Cultural Revolution experience.

Understanding Xi Jinping and Continuity in CCP Leadership

• Xi Jinping was initially a compromise candidate, viewed as harmless by party factions, similar historically to figures like Stalin or Ceausescu.
• Despite his benign public persona initially, Xi has dramatically consolidated power, leveraging resources and infrastructure built by predecessors to enhance surveillance, military, and domestic control.
• Xi’s aggressive stance on Taiwan and other geopolitical issues aligns with longstanding CCP policy rather than a new or unique aggression.

China’s Military Capabilities and Taiwan Crisis

• Dikötter argues that China's military might is questionable, as it is largely untested since the disastrous invasion of Vietnam in 1979 and the internal crackdown at Tiananmen in 1989.
• Despite significant investments, the real effectiveness and willingness of the PLA (People’s Liberation Army) to fight are uncertain, particularly due to internal corruption and political purges under Xi.
• Taiwan is considered strategically critical for the CCP, representing a significant geopolitical risk to the U.S. and allies, akin to an "unsinkable battleship" near China's coast.

CCP Paranoia and Fear as Central to Governance

• Dikötter repeatedly emphasizes that paranoia and fear fundamentally drive CCP decision-making, both domestically (fear of counter-revolution) and internationally (fear of capitalist encirclement).
• China's oppressive policies and extreme measures, such as the COVID lockdowns, reveal deep-rooted paranoia, leading to alienation among its population.
• Surveillance, censorship, and suppression of dissent reflect a regime deeply fearful of internal and external threats, indicating underlying instability.

U.S. and Global Perceptions of China

• Western misconceptions about China’s economic and political trajectory have been widespread, resulting in misguided policies like overly optimistic views on WTO accession.
• Recent geopolitical shifts and events, particularly COVID-19, have significantly altered Western views of China, shifting from naivety to heightened caution or even overestimation of Chinese power.
• Dikötter advises continued caution and containment policy, asserting that China is internally fragile and economically unsustainable under current CCP practices.

Strategic Recommendations for U.S. Policy (Containment)

• Dikötter advocates for a strong containment policy similar to the Cold War strategy used against the Soviet Union.
• He argues that China’s internal contradictions and weaknesses, including economic inefficiencies, aging demographics, and political discontent, will inevitably weaken the CCP’s grip.
• Containment should be patient but firm, limiting China’s influence without unnecessary escalation, ultimately letting internal pressures build within China.

Impact of China’s Global Ambitions on American Life

• If China’s global influence grows unchecked (e.g., capturing Taiwan), Dikötter argues it could significantly impact American freedoms, increasing global surveillance, reducing democratic freedoms, and promoting authoritarian norms worldwide.
• He emphasizes that CCP ambitions have no practical limits due to intrinsic fear and insecurity, thus presenting a persistent global threat.

Final Reflections and Outlook

• Dikötter strongly critiques the narrative of China as an unstoppable superpower, underscoring severe internal weaknesses beneath its powerful image.
• He maintains cautious optimism regarding U.S. capabilities to confront and contain China effectively, emphasizing confidence in American and democratic resilience despite current geopolitical tensions.
• Ultimately, he posits that patient containment and internal contradictions within China will likely limit CCP power in the long term.
